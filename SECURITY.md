# Security Policy

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosures.

- Reporting: Please use GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting (Security Advisories) for this repository. Do not open public issues for security reports.
- Scope: Contract code under `src/` and critical test scaffolding under `test/`.
- Response: We aim to acknowledge new reports within 72 hours and provide status updates as triage progresses.
- Disclosure: We will coordinate a responsible disclosure timeline and publish details after a fix or mitigation is available.

If Private Vulnerability Reporting is unavailable for you, contact the repository maintainers via the repository owner’s profile.

Thank you for helping keep FigaroProtocol safe for everyone.
